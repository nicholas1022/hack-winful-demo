## Motivation

**We are a group of IT professionals from Hong Kong.**

In early 2024, we participated in the first HK-CAN Hackathon in Toronto. At the event, we were presented with a real-world business challenge and seized the opportunity to apply our technological expertise to craft a tailored solution for our client, Winful Seafood International Ltd in 3 weeks.
